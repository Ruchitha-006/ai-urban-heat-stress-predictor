# 🌡️ AI Urban Heat Stress Predictor

An AI-powered system that predicts **heat stress risk for urban workers** using real-time weather data and personal health factors.
The system combines **Machine Learning, FastAPI, and Streamlit** to provide real-time alerts and risk prediction.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Urban workers such as **delivery personnel, construction workers, street vendors, and traffic police** are exposed to high temperatures for long periods. Excessive heat can cause:

* Heat exhaustion
* Dehydration
* Increased heart rate
* Blood pressure variation
* Heat stroke

This project predicts **heat stress risk levels** using environmental data and personal factors to help prevent health emergencies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict **personalized heat stress risk**
* Integrate **weather data API**
* Provide **real-time alerts**
* Build an **AI-driven health monitoring system**
* Create an interactive **dashboard for visualization**
